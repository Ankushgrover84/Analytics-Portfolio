1. Project 1: Predictive Modeling and Analysis of Boston Housing Prices

Project 1 : Predictive Modeling and Analysis of Boston Housing Prices
Description: This project aims to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston using a variety of features such as crime rate, number of rooms, and more. The project includes exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and predictive modeling, culminating in an optimized Random Forest model.
Techniques Used: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Selection (LASSO), Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search)
Libraries Used: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy
Datasets: The dataset contains 506 samples and 14 features, including the target variable. It comprises various indicators that potentially influence housing prices in Boston, such as crime rate, pupil-teacher ratio, etc.
